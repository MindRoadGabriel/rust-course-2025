Simple client and message serialization

Use the protocol.rs file and add bincode to your project, and send a
ClientMessage::Hello to your server. Decode incoming messages from the
server, and do a print if it's a ServerMessage::Welcome.

Modify the server to decode the incoming ClientMessage and send a
ServerMessage::Welcome back if the incoming message was ClientMessage::Hello

Useful snippets:
   bincode::serialize_into(&socket, &client_message);
   let incoming_message = bincode::deserialize_from::<&TcpStream, ServerMessage>(&socket);
