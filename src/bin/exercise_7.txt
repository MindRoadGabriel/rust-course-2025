Exercise 7: Refactoring the server to use channels instead of RwLock.

a) Duplicate exercise_7.rs to exercise_8.rs.
b) Make a central thread that receives messages when a socket connects, disconnects or receives data from its remote client.
c) Move the vector of sockets to a central thread, and have it add and remove sockets based on the messages.
d) Have the central thread forward text from any sockets to all other sockets.
e) Use the main thread for listening for new connections and creating client threads.

Useful snippets:
   let (sender, receiver) = std::sync::mpsc::channel::<SocketEvent>();
   sender.send(SocketEvent::Connect(socket_id, socket_clone))
