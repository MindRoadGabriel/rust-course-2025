Refactoring the server to use channels instead of RwLock.

Create a thread for message handling, that receives messages from other
threads. Create an enum for the message. Use your main thread to listen for
new sockets. In each socket thread, send a connection message and disconnection
message to the message handling thread in the start and end, In-between,
forward all received data to the message handling thread.

Useful snippets:
   let (sender, receiver) = std::sync::mpsc::channel::<SocketEvent>();
   sender.send(SocketEvent::Connect(socket_id, socket_clone))
