Exercise 11: Tie it all together. (Client)

Duplicate exercise_5.rs to exercise_11.rs.
Also use code from exercise_8.rs.
Implement the client for this game!

Have the client cycle through three states.
a) Displaying the city name and asking the user to guess where the city is by clicking,
b) asking the player to wait for the other players to guess,
c) and displaying the distance between the guess and the correct coordinate
along with circles for the clicked coordinate and the correct coordinate.

When you're done, connect to the teacher server and play with others who are done.
