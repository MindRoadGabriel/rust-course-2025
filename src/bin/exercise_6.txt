Exercise 6: Simple server time!

a) Create an exercise_6.rs file.
b) For each incoming socket, add it to a thread-shared vector, then create a thread for it.
c) In that thread, write a hello message, then read the first message and send it to all other sockets.
d) If on windows, add the windows feature for telnet client. To handle windows terminal encoding, add codepage_437 to the project with "cargo add codepage_437".
e) Start three terminals, and run this in each of them:
telnet localhost 12345
f) Then try typing and see your text appear on the other terminals.

Useful snippets:
    for socket in listener.incoming() {}
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    let len = socket.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&buffer[0..len]).unwrap();
    use codepage_437::{BorrowFromCp437, CP437_CONTROL};
    let s = String::borrow_from_cp437(&buffer[0..len], &CP437_CONTROL);
