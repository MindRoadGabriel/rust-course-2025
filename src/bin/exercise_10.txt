Draw the rest of the owl. (Client)

Implement a game client for your server and base it on your world map program
from exercise 5.

Have the client cycle through three states. Displaying the city name and
asking the user to guess where the city is by clicking, asking the player to
wait for the other players to guess, and displaying the distance between the
guess and the correct coordinate along with circles for the clicked coordinate
and the correct coordinate.

When you're done, connect to the teacher server and play with others who are done.
